# Credit Risk Modelling Prediction
Credit risk modeling is a method used by financial institutions to assess the likelihood of a borrower defaulting on a loan or not being able to repay it. Credit risk modeling can help lenders make more informed decisions when deciding whether or not to lend money to an individual or a business.

There are various statistical models used for credit risk modeling, including logistic regression, decision trees, and support vector machines. These models use various inputs such as the borrower's credit score, income, debt-to-income ratio, and other factors to generate a probability of default.

## **Requirements**

To run this project, you will need the following software:

-Python 3
-NumPy
-Pandas
-Scikit-learn
-Matplotlib

## **Machine learning project steps**

To build a credit risk model on the data, there are several steps that need to be taken. Here's a general outline of the process:

>1. **Data cleaning and preprocessing:** 

This involves handling missing values, dealing with categorical variables, and transforming the data into a format suitable for modeling.

>2. **Feature engineering:** 

This involves creating new features from the existing data that may be useful for modeling, such as ratios and interaction terms.

>3. **Model selection and evaluation:** 

This involves selecting a suitable model for the data and evaluating its performance using appropriate metrics.

>4. **Model tuning and validation:** 

This involves fine-tuning the model hyperparameters and validating the final model using cross-validation or other techniques.

## **Model Evaluation**
The performance of the machine learning model is evaluated using two metrics:

>**Accuracy:** Accuracy measures the proportion of correctly classified instances out of the total number of instances. A higher accuracy indicates better performance of the model.

>**F1 score:** F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. It takes into account both false positives and false negatives. A high F1 score indicates better performance of the model.

In this project, we achieved an accuracy of 0.82 and an F1 score of 0.96, which are decent results. However, it's important to remember that these metrics do not tell the whole story and it's necessary to consider the overall context of the problem and the model's limitations.

# Conclusion
It is important to note that while machine learning can improve credit risk modeling, it is not a silver bullet and requires careful implementation and monitoring. Lenders must ensure that their models are transparent, explainable, and free from bias, and that they comply with regulatory requirements and ethical standards.
