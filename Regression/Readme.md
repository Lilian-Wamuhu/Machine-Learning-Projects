# Boston House Price Prediction

This is a machine learning project that aims to predict the prices of Boston house prices using linear regression algorithms. The project utilizes Python programming language and popular machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn, pandas, and matplotlib.

## Dataset

The dataset is a famous dataset contains information about different features of houses in Boston such as the number of rooms, accessibility to highways, etc. The target variable is the median value of owner-occupied homes in thousands of dollars. The dataset is provided in a CSV format and is preprocessed to remove any irrelevant or missing data.

## Requirements

The following Python libraries are required to run this project:

- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib

You can install these libraries using the following command:
>pip install scikit-learn pandas numpy matplotlib

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `Boston_House_Pricing.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the main code for data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation using linear regression and Lasso regression algorithms.
- `train.txt`: file containing the dataset used for training and testing the models.
- `README.md`: This file, providing documentation and instructions for the project.

# Machine learning project steps

Here are the general steps of a typical machine learning workflow:

1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Cleaning the data by removing duplicates, filling missing values, and converting categorical data to numerical format. Preprocessing the data by scaling, normalizing, or transforming it for better performance.

2. **Data Splitting**: Splitting the data into training and testing sets to evaluate the performance of the model.

3. **Model Selection**: Choosing an appropriate machine learning model based on the type of problem, data, and desired output. Common machine learning models include Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines, Neural Networks, etc.

4. **Model Training**: Feeding the training data into the chosen machine learning model to make it learn from the data and adjust its internal parameters to improve its performance.

5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating the performance of the trained model using performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and confusion matrix.

6. **Model Deployment**: Deploying the trained machine learning model into a production environment for real-world use.

## Usage

This dataset can be used for regression analysis to predict the median value of owner-occupied homes based on the available features. It can also be used for exploratory data analysis and visualization to gain insights about the relationships between the features and the target variable.

Steps for using the dataset:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/Lilian-Wamuhu/Machine-Learning-Projects/tree/main/Regression

2. Install the required libraries using the command mentioned in the "Requirements" section.

3. Open the `Boston_House_Pricing.ipynb` notebook in Google Colab or any other IDE.

4. Run the notebook cells sequentially to preprocess the data, engineer features, train the linear regression model, and evaluate its performance.

5. Experiment with different hyperparameters, feature engineering techniques, and evaluation metrics to fine-tune the models and improve their accuracy.

6. You can also modify the `train.txt` file or replace it with your own dataset to train the models on different data.

## Results

The project aims to predict the prices of Boston houses with good accuracy using linear regression algorithms. The performance of the model can be evaluated using various metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and R-squared score. The results of the model may vary depending on the dataset used, feature engineering techniques, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation metrics employed.

## Conclusion

The Boston Housing dataset is a well-known benchmark dataset in machine learning and statistics. It contains attributes that describe various features of houses in the Boston area, including crime rate, zoning, number of rooms, accessibility to highways, and median value of owner-occupied homes. The dataset can be used for regression analysis to predict the median value of homes based on the available features, as well as for exploratory data analysis and visualization to gain insights about the relationships between the features and the target variable. The dataset was originally published in 1978 and has since been used in various machine learning research and educational settings.
